This is a basic instructions for those working with plink program 
We had initial vcf file with genotypes frequencies from patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. We wanted to compare them with genotypes frequencies of healthy donors from 1000G project. For this purpose we chose populations of Non-Finnish Europeans and Americans from Utah State, which we believed have close ethnical background to Slavic population, which most our patients belonged to.
